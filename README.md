# Ligaturized Inconsolata-dz

This is the [`Inconsolata-dz`/`Inconsolata_dz` font](https://nodnod.net/posts/inconsolata-dz/) which includes ligatures added using the [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer) library.

Once you've installed them, to use with your code editor of choice, use the name `Liga Inconsolata-dz`/`Liga Inconsolata_dz`, respectively. You may have to restart your editor before seeing the font being applied.

This note from the original author explains the only difference between the two fonts:

> Update Dec 5, 2020: Some versions of Emacs 24+ are seeing issues with fonts that use hyphens in the name, eg, `Inconsolata-dz`. Iâ€™ve updated the files list below to include a version of Inconsolata-dz named `Inconsolata_dz`, with underscores.
